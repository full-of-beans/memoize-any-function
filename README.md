## The technique of memoizing 😙

Really helps in increasing the speed of computation of caching out the results...
It accomplishes this by compensating space for speed 🚀

### When to use❓
👉 When the function's output is purely dependent on the function's input.
In simple terms, use this technique on pure functions only...

👉 Also, in the ideal case scenario, they should be used in functions that have limited input range.
